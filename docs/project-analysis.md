### Data Structure

- **packages.ts** - Contains all package data including pricing, descriptions, deliverables
- Packages categorized as: 'release', 'addon', 'website', 'merch'

## Current Issues (Based on Client Feedback)

1. **Information Overload**: Single page contains too much information

   - All package sections on one page
   - Pricing mixed with service descriptions
   - Multiple complex sections stacked vertically

2. **Missing Floating Consultation**:

   - Currently has PlanBuilderDrawer but needs dedicated consultation booking
   - Need persistent, easily accessible booking CTA

3. **Pricing Accessibility**:

   - Pricing is embedded within service descriptions
   - No dedicated pricing overview
   - Difficult to compare prices across services

4. **Services Overview**:
   - No clean list of services without pricing
   - Services are scattered across different package sections

## Recommended Solution Architecture

### New Page Structure

1. **Home** - Simplified landing page with overview
2. **Services** - Clean list of services without pricing
3. **Pricing** - Dedicated pricing page/tab
4. **Booking** - Enhanced booking experience
5. **About/Process** - Company info and process

### Component Updates Needed

1. Create floating consultation button
2. Separate pricing components from service descriptions
3. Create simplified service overview components
4. Restructure navigation to support multiple pages

## Design System

- **Color Scheme**: Neon theme with blue, purple, pink, cyan gradients
- **Typography**: Bold, modern with gradient text effects
- **Animations**: Smooth transitions, floating animations, fade-ins
- **Layout**: Responsive design with container-based layout
